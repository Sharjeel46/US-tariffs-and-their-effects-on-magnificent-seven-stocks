Tariff announcements such as **$50B Tariff (2018)** and **Consumer Tariffs (2019)** visibly impacted stock movements. This animation clearly visualizes the real-time market response to U.S. trade policy.\n\n\"U.S. tariffs on China from 2018 to 2025 had a noticeable impact on domestic capital markets, especially tech stocks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project analyzes the impact of U.S. tariffs on the \"Magnificent Seven\" technology stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—using historical stock price data sourced from Yahoo Finance via the quantmod package in R. The code processes adjusted closing prices from 2018 through mid-2025, visualizing price movements alongside key tariff event dates. These tariffs, announced and implemented at various points between 2018 and 2025, have significantly influenced market valuations, causing sharp declines and volatility in these tech giants’ stocks. For example, following tariff announcements, the Magnificent Seven collectively lost trillions in market value, with intermittent rebounds when tariffs were paused or eased. By integrating tariff event labels directly into animated stock price charts with gganimate, the project clearly illustrates how trade policy uncertainty and tariff actions have shaped investor sentiment and stock performance over time.
