Tariff announcements hit supply chainâ€“dependent firms like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, and Nvidia the hardest. I gathered stock data using the \"quantmod\" package in R from Yahoo Finance, covering the Magnificent Seven tech stocks from 2018 to 2025..\n\n\n\n## ðŸŽ¥ Stock Price Animation with U.S. Tariff Events\n![](stocks_tariffs.gif)\n\n**Discription**\nThe animated graph shows the stock prices (in USD) of the Magnificent Seven from 2018 to 2025. Key U.S.â€“China tariff events are marked with red dashed lines. At the start of each tariff event, there is a noticeable drop in the prices of supply chainâ€“dependent stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. A yellow box highlights Appleâ€™s stock price at the beginning of each event.\n\nThis is a raw data visualization that includes all major factors affecting these stocks. The exact impact of tariffs on each stock will be analyzed in the main project using regression and other statistical tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
